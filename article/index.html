    <h1>Troubleshooting DNS Error 1001 for Website Builder </h1>

    <p>Homestead websites built using Website Builder can be secured using free SSL. Normal SSL installation can be done
        by updating the A record to point to secure IP address which can be found in this <a
            href="https://community.homestead.com/conversations/websitebuilder/websitebuilder-ssl/5f2a9b3158180958845dab29">link</a>
        However, there are cases where DNS Error 1001 appears after updating the A record.

    <p>The Engineering Team is aware of this problem and looking for a permanent resolution. As a workaround, kindly
        follow the instructions below. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a temporary website using Website Builder in Websites Manager page.
            <h2><span class="collapse">+</span>To create a new Website Builder site:</h2>
            <ol class="second-level-ol content-group">
                <li>Log in to your Homestead account.</li>
                <li>
                    Click on the Websites Manager tab, then click on Add New Website.
                    <img class="img-wb" src="./img/createsitestep1.png" alt="">
                </li>
                <li>Please provide a unique name for the site. This is just a placeholder that your site will be built
                    under until you choose a domain name. Alternatively, you can choose to only use the site name, in
                    which case, your site will work with the .homesteadcloud.com URL.</li>
                <li>Click Add this Site. If the site name is already in use, you will be prompted to choose a different
                    name.
                    You do not enter a domain name in this space.</li>
                <li>If your name is available, you will be taken back to the Websites Manager page.
                    <img class="img-wb" src="./img/createsitestep5.png" alt="Select Site Name Image">
                </li>
                <li>If you are ready to move on, click Choose Design.
                    <img class="img-wb" src="./img/createsitestep6.png" alt="Choose Design Image">
                </li>
                <li>Select any template for the temporary website. No need to publish.
                    <img class="img-wb" src="./img/createsitestep7.png" alt="Select Template Image">
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Associate the domain to the temporary website.
            <ol class="second-level-ol">
                <li>Click the "Domains" link in the left navigation menu.</li>
                <li>Scroll down until you see your domain name and click Change Site Association.
                    <img class="img-wb" src="./img/site-assoc.png" alt="Change Site Association Image">
                </li>
                <li>Choose the website you'd like your domain name to point to using the drop-down menu.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to confirm the change.<br><br>
                    It may take some time for this change to reflect.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">Note: Please take note of the Homestead Cloud URL for the original website as the domain
                will be
                reassociated to it later. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Republish the original website without the domain name using the Homestead Cloud URL only.</li>
        <li>After 5-15 minutes, re-associate the domain to the original website.</li>
        <li>Publish the website with the domain.</li>
        <li>Open homesteadssl.com by entering the domain name in the text box.</li>
        <li>Click Next.
            <p class="note">Note: Kindly disregard if the last 2 digits of the IP address are different from the current
                A record.
                Homestead uses a secured IP range for SSL certificates. </p>
        </li>
        <li>Advise customer for standard propagation time within 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Delete the temporary website unless instructed by customer not to do so.</li>
