        </li>
        <li>After you performed Step #5, you will be redirected to the Audit Report. On the top of the Audit Report,
            there will be options to Acknowledge or Dispute. If the Audit Report already expired or has been
            acknowledged already, the options to Acknowledge or Dispute will be no longer available.
            
            <p class="note">Note: You can only
            acknowledge or dispute within 48 hours after the QA has performed the Audit.
            </p>
            Please see below screenshot as an example of an audit successfully acknowledged. The highlighted area is
            also the same area you will see the options to Acknowledge or Dispute
